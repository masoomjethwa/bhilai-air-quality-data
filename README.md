Air Pollutant Data Analysis & Visualization in Bhilai, IndiaA Comprehensive Exploratory Study of Air Quality Trends1. OverviewThis repository hosts a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project focused on air pollutant data from Bhilai, India. The project aims to provide deep insights into pollutant concentrations, their temporal trends, and inter-relationships, which are crucial for environmental policy-making and public awareness.The core of this project is a Python script that cleans raw data, performs various analyses, and generates 40 different publication-ready charts.2. DatasetThe primary dataset used in this analysis is consolidated_pollutant_data_bhilai.csv.Key Columns:Date: Date of the air quality measurement.Sheet: Identifier for the original data sheet, potentially indicating different monitoring stations or data collection periods.Location: Geographic location of the measurement (assumed to be Bhilai for this dataset).NO2: Nitrogen Dioxide concentration (mug/m3).SO2: Sulfur Dioxide concentration (mug/m3).PM10: Particulate Matter 10 concentration (mug/m3).PM2.5: Particulate Matter 2.5 concentration (mug/m3).O3_8hrs: Ozone (8-hour average) concentration (mug/m3).CO_8hrs_mg_m3: Carbon Monoxide (8-hour average) concentration (mg/m3).NH3: Ammonia concentration (mug/m3).Pb: Lead concentration (mug/m3).The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values and ensure correct data types before analysis.3. Project ObjectivesTo implement robust data loading and cleaning procedures for raw air pollutant data.To generate a diverse set of 40 high-quality, publication-ready visualizations that highlight various aspects of air quality.To analyze and interpret pollutant distributions, temporal patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), and correlations.To identify potential outliers and seasonal trends in pollutant concentrations.4.

5. Setup and InstallationTo run this analysis locally, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
(Replace your-username/your-repo-name.git with your actual repository URL)Install Python dependencies:It's recommended to use a virtual environment.python -m venv venv
# On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn pathlib statsmodels scikit-learn
Place your data:Ensure consolidated_pollutant_data_bhilai.csv is in the root directory of the cloned repository.6. How to Run the AnalysisExecute the main Python script from your terminal:python analysis_of_bhillai_data.py
The script will:Load and clean the data.Save the cleaned data to cleaned_data/cleaned_pollutant_data_bhilai.csv.Generate all 40 charts and save them as PNG files in the charts_output/ directory.Print progress messages to the console.7. Key Visualizations and Insights(This section should be filled by you after running the analysis and reviewing the generated charts. Here are some examples of what you might include:)Pollutant Distributions: Histograms (e.g., chart_1_hist_NO2.png) show the frequency of different concentration levels, revealing if pollutants are normally distributed or skewed.Temporal Trends: Time series plots (e.g., chart_6_timeseries_NO2.png) illustrate how pollutant levels change over time. Monthly and yearly averages (e.g., chart_11_monthly_avg_pm10.png) help identify seasonal or long-term trends.Daily Patterns: Box plots or strip plots by Day of Week (e.g., chart_14_weekly_avg_so2.png, chart_22_strip_plot_pm10_dayofweek.png) can reveal if pollution varies significantly on weekdays vs. weekends.Correlations: The correlation heatmap (chart_16_correlation_heatmap.png) is crucial for understanding relationships between different pollutants. For instance, a strong positive correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 suggests they often originate from similar sources.Data Source Comparison: The stacked bar chart of average pollutant by sheet (chart_38_stacked_bar_avg_pollutant_by_sheet.png) helps compare pollutant profiles across different data sources or monitoring locations.Outlier Detection: The Z-score outlier plot (chart_37_zscore_outlier_no2.png) highlights data points that deviate significantly from the norm, potentially indicating unusual pollution events or data errors.8. Conclusion and Future WorkThis project provides a foundational exploratory analysis of air quality in Bhilai. The extensive set of visualizations offers a robust starting point for deeper investigations.Potential Future Enhancements:Advanced Time Series Forecasting: Implement predictive models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to forecast future pollutant concentrations.Source Apportionment: Integrate meteorological data (wind speed/direction, temperature, humidity) and local activity data to identify major pollution sources.Geospatial Analysis: If precise GPS coordinates for monitoring stations become available, visualize pollutant dispersion and hotspots on interactive maps.Compliance Assessment: Compare observed pollutant levels against national or international air quality standards to assess compliance and identify areas of concern.Interactive Dashboards: Develop interactive web dashboards (e.g., using Plotly Dash or Streamlit) to allow users to dynamically explore the data and visualizations.9.
